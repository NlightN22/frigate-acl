# ACL Frigate features
You can define roles on the keycloack authorization server. 
Based on the roles you have defined, you can grant access on the client in the Access section.
You can also set the birdseye role to define user access through the role.


## How it works
I created proxy-server witch modify answers from frigate API. 
And that is the reason for set frigate server to private localhost (127.0.0.1) and must be closed from external connections!
I don't want to modify frigate backend and frontend too much, and i added only two pages on frontend.
I can't make normal build for frontend, because vite builder had too much modifications, and it does not work correctly. 
And the one more reason to not use builder - frigate production version works on docker with root rights, like node.
I mainly use nestjs, mongodb, mongo-express. Mongo-express is optional
